# NBA-Back-To-Back-Analysis
This project explores the impact on NBA players of playing "back-to-back" games. (A back-to-back occurs when a team plays two games two nights in a row.)

The analysis investigates how player efficiency and usage change in the second game of a back-to-back. This is achieved by comparing features across two datasets filtered by all player performances against player performances exclusively in the second game of back-to-backs.
